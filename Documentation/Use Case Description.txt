	The SET keyboard application is directed towards people with disabilities that inhibit their ability to physically and verbally
communicate. Users use the application's eye tracking capabilities to type characters via the QWERTY or T9 keyboard. The application
as a whole, is organized by a tab controller. This enables keyboard types, output options, and stored sentences to live within
separate tabs within the application providing the user with an intuitive user interface. More details regarding the semantics of
eye tracking input can be found in the rquirments definition section of the project scope.
	When a user launches the application, they are met with a GUI consisting of a console, a QWERTY keyboard, and a tab controller. The console
contains buttons to allow for scrolling, in the event that there was a text overflow. Furthermore it has a button to clear its text. The QWERTY keyboard
is one of two keyboards the user can interact with, both accessable through a tab selection bar. An output tab exists as well, providing the ability 
to output what is on the console via text to file, text to speech, or text to clipboard. Other tabs can be created or deleted by the user. These tabs
are reffered to as "custom tabs," and contain blocks of user-stored sentences that can be used at a later time. These stored sentences can be added or
deleted at the users will.
	Text input involves holding focuss on a specific key for a certain amount of time. The selected key character is then appended to the text in
the console. Word completion then displays a list of predictions below the console, allowing the user to select a completed word. When a word is completed, 
predictions for the following word will appear below the console. Again, the user is able to select a word to be appended to the text in the console.
