To be able to run our code, you will first have to download and set up openCV version 2.4.6(latest version) for
for VS 2010/2012 on windows 7/8 on a 32bit VS version. The installation guide for openCV that worked for our
team is on:

http://www.slideshare.net/helloansuman/how-to-nstall-opencv-246-using-visual-studio-2010-2012-in-windows-7-8-for-32-bit-machine-only

Once you have set everything up and are ready to build the code, 
copy ../opencv/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt over to main.cpp's directory.

If you have any issues with regard to setting up your environment for openCV or getting EyeTracker.cpp 
to run with its dependencies, you can contact the SET team at slouie@umich.edu.
