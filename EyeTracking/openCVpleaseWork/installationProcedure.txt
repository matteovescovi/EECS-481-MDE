After trying out multiple openCV installation guides, one of them finally worked.

This guide, like the link suggests, only works for openCV version 2.4.6(latest version) 
for VS 2010/2012 on windows 7/8 on a 32bit machine/ VS version. If you have any issues with regard to setting up
your environment for openCV or getting main.cpp to run with its dependencies, feel free to contact anyone from the 
eye-tracking group.

Once you have set everything up and are ready to build the code, 
copy ../opencv/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt over to main.cpp's directory.
